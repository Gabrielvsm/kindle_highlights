# Kindle Highlights :books:
This tool is a personal project that aims to help me automate the process of turning kindle highlights into topics in a markdown file for further use.

## How to use it :wrench:
Just use the `ruby` command word followed by the path of the .csv containing the highlights and the path to the .md
```bash
ruby src/app.rb <highlights_path> <markdown_path>
```
